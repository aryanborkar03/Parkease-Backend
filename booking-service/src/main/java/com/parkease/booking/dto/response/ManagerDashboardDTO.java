 * Aggregated dashboard payload returned to a Lot Manager.
 *
 * activeBookings   – Bookings currently in progress (status = ACTIVE,
 *                    i.e. driver has checked in and is still parked).
 * upcomingBookings – Future reservations (status = RESERVED, startTime > now)
 *                    that have not yet started.
 *
 * This mirrors the BookMyShow-style time-aware seat state view — the manager
 * can see who is currently parked and who is arriving next.
