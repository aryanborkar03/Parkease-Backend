/**
 * Represents the two booking modes supported by ParkEase:
 *
 * PRE_BOOKING  – User reserves a spot in advance by specifying a future
 *                start/end time window. The booking starts in RESERVED status
 *                and transitions to ACTIVE only after check-in (within the
 *                grace period).
 *
 * DRIVE_IN     – User arrives at the lot and books on the spot. The booking
 *                starts immediately (startTime = now) and is auto-activated
 *                (status set to ACTIVE) upon creation — no separate check-in
 *                grace period applies.
